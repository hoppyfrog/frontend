# frontend
React frontend for bar app. Some of the tools used:
- NPM: build tool (run `npm run` to see run scripts available)
- Webpack: module bundler
- Babel: compiles ES6 to ES5
- eslint: linter configured to use airbnb style
- mocha: unit testing (with enzyme we can test react components without DOM)
- surge: deploys app to http://barmatcher.surge.sh
